# 🎉 Bingo Game (Player vs Computer) 🎉

**📌 About the Game**

This is a turn-based Bingo game where you compete against the computer (AI). Each player has a 5x5 Bingo board filled with numbers from 1 to 25, shuffled randomly. The game follows traditional Bingo rules, where both the player and AI strike off the same called number from their boards.

**🔥 Game Features**

✅ Turn-based play: The player picks a number first, then the AI selects a number.

✅ Hidden boards: Each player can only see their own board (AI cannot see yours, and vice versa).

✅ Automatic AI move: The AI automatically picks a random number from its available numbers.

✅ Winning Condition: The first to complete five full lines (rows, columns, or diagonals) wins the game.

✅ Responsive UI: Designed for a smooth gaming experience with stylish buttons and animations.

✅ Restart Option: A "Restart Game" button lets you start fresh anytime.

**🎯 How to Play?**

1️⃣ The player starts by clicking a number on their board.

2️⃣ Both the player and the AI strike off that number from their respective boards.

3️⃣ The AI then picks a number, and both strike it off.

4️⃣ The game continues until one player completes five lines.

5️⃣ The winner is announced with a victory message!

**🛠️ Technologies Used**

React.js: Frontend framework for building the UI.

CSS : For sleek, responsive design.

JavaScript (Logic & AI): Handles the Bingo logic, number selection, and winner detection.
